Protocols for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Data from the 2020 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition



Water sample collection

In conjunction with each CTD, water was collected using Niskin bottles at 3.5 m, 5 m, 25 m, 50 m,
100 m, and 300 m depths. The 3.5 m sample was exclusively used for eDNA analysis (4000 ml).
Nutrient samples (13 ml) were collected from all other depths. In addition to nutrients, water
samples from 5 m depth were collected for phytoplankton pigments (HPLC; 2000 ml),
phytoplankton taxonomy (200 ml), and Particulate Organic Matter (POM; 4000 ml). At some
stations only 3.5 m and 5 m water samples collected due to sea conditions.

Oceanographic water processing

Samples were taken below deck for onboard processing, within 30 minutes of collection. For HPLC,
water was stored in dark bottles until filtration when 2000 ml was filtered through a 0.7 mm
Whatman GF/F 47 mm filter. Filters were immediately transferred to a cryo-vial, flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and transferred to dry ice for long-term storage. Samples for phytoplankton
taxonomy comprised 200 ml of water preserved with 6 drops of Lugol’s solution. POM samples
comprised replicate 2000 ml samples were filtered onto different pre-combusted Whatman
GF/F 25 mm filters. After filtration, 2.5 ml of 1 M HCl was added to one of the filters and let to
stand for 30 seconds before draining and rinsing the funnel with filtered seawater. Each filter was
folded in half within a piece of tinfoil and stored in the -20 °C freezer. Nutrient samples (13 ml)
were stored in the -20 °C freezer immediately post-collection. POM samples are designated to be
analyzed for carbon / nitrogen content and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes.
